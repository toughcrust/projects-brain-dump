Opposition Gemini - Sagittarius  
When opposing signs are in balance, certain traits emerge that transcend either sign individually and allow for the heightened functioning of both  
Gemini energy: gather raw data, ask a myriad of questions, gain clarity as to the basic signifance of how things as a separate entity.  
=&gt; left brain  
Sagittarius energy: Synthetizer, know it all, seeks comprehensive view that speaks to the order of the universe \(disparate parts =&gt; big picture\)  
=&gt; right brain

synthesis: a honest appreciation of logic while making room for intuitive insights which come by way of inspiration

In fact, Aquarius and the 8th house have a lot to tell each other, and can, if integrated, represent the core strength of emotional intelligence.

Typically, the North Node lessons here have to do with integrating one’s darker nature with the way you live your life out where everyone can see it. This automatically places an emphasis on hypocrisy, since people who are uncomfortable with the 8/2 axis, its physicality, emotional needs and an overall inability to explain its actions coherently or ‘rationally’ tend to lie about their deeper feelings, pretending they’re ‘fine.’ The raw instinctual nature of the 8/2 axis tends to stand out for Aquarius North Node, which is why I expect Leo South Node to dominate, since it’s so often easier for the individual to express that combination than it is to express Aquarius in the 8th.

The purpose of the lifetime then might be described as bringing emotions to the surface so that they can be understood rationally. If this native doesn’t become comfortable with expressing his 8th house reality, it’s going to block his overall life purpose. So everything depends on the rest of the chart; does it support water or air? Is the individual going to ‘bury’ his or her 8th house nature, or is s/he going to take the hard road toward self-awareness?


My catharsis \(obsession\) is about balancing my inner life, easing communication with myself.

A Mercury Retrograde native absorbs information on a more subjective level than a Mercury-direct native would. Facts will be taken from something this person hears, sees or reads, but **what is focused on most is the essence or the feeling this person gets from this information**. One with Mercury in retrograde will have inner conversations with themselves about something, which leads to an intensified perspective, and then have a difficult time outwardly expressing it. This often leads to one feeling greatly misunderstood. **Another focus for those with Mercury Retrograde is other peoples’ motives** – even if their intuitions may not be in tune with reality, **they will focus on whether or not others mean what they say**.

**Although many decisions are thought out in depth, other decisions are made rashly because you are frustrated with your thoughts going in circles.**

When Mercury is retrograde, the thought processes are introspective, deliberate and internalized. Before any personal matter can be discussed, it must be processed internally.  
This means that, if you want to discuss a personal matter with a Mercury Retrograde friend, you must tell them what you want to discuss and set up an appointment to discuss it. If you want an immediate answer, you will not get an honest or well though out answer. They need time to brood and ponder.

Because these people need to digest and process first, they are slow to defend themselves and slow to respond to queries of a personal nature unless they are prepared ahead of time.

* They appreciate a slow reaction in another.
* They can easily discuss non-personal subjects, their own interests and expertise, without introspection. This has already been done in the past.   
  On personal subjects, they may not know immediately how they feel about something, they need that brood and ponder time.

Moon in Aquarius is humane, sincere, logical, independent, unconventional, progressive, ingenious, and friendly. Feelings tend to be cool and detached but are honest and steady even if odd. One is usually interested in psychology, social reform, and has a wide variety of friends and associates. Personality tends to be mental with a quirky sense of humor. Imagination inclines toward science fiction and utopian plans for the future. One is often altruistic and humanitarian, although others may not suspect it, because the feelings may not be particularly warm.

Moon in seventh house: In order to have successful partnerships, you need to control your need and urge to depend upon others. Moodiness is something that both you and your partner, whether in marriage or business, need to control. Also, you need to curb your desire for constant changes in the relationship and seek stability. As for your career, you have a strong need for partnerships. You prefer to work in a team than alone and rely upon others to fulfill your work responsibilities. 
These chart holders need relationships with other people in order to feel comfortable with their own lives. Interactions with partners comfort them. They are looking to get their own needs satisfied and there may always be someone who can do this better than their current partner. Add this to the fact that their expert skill at attracting and negotiating with people is unconscious, so that they don't even have to try to excel at it, and you have a person who can easily float from one relationship to the next.

Une fois j'ai rêvé que j'étais une araignée en essayant une "régression" [https://alltotems.com/spirit-animals/spider-symbolism-meaning/](https://alltotems.com/spirit-animals/spider-symbolism-meaning/)


In her book, Varda Hasselmann describes the seven soul age levels of the old soul as follows:

Level 1 - Act against conventional morals from inner conviction

Level 2 - Honestly admire yourself, dispense with the admiration of others

**Level 3 - Combine precise introspection with active results**

**Level 4 - Unite your well-being with the welfare of the community**

**Level 5 - Follow a path unwaveringly without knowing where it leads**

Level 6 - Impress by being, not by doing

Level 7 - Receive without giving, give without receiving
